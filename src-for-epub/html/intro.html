Venerable Ajahn Chah was a master at using the apt and unusual simile to explain points of Dhamma. Sometimes he would make an abstract point clear with a vivid and simple image; sometimes he’d tease out the implications of an image in a way that suggested many layers of meaning, offering food for continued thought. In other words, some of his similes provided answers, whereas others provoked questions.
</p><p>
Since his death, several collections of similes have been drawn from his Dhamma talks. The present translation is based primarily on a collection compiled by one of his Thai students, Ajahn Jandee, in the early years of this decade. I say ‘primarily’ because I have introduced the following changes:
</p><p>
Three of the similes in the original collection have been replaced by three others, drawn from the talk, ‘Disenchanted with What You Like’ (<i>Byya khawng thii chawb</i>); ‘Bottled Water, Spring Water’; ‘The Fence’; and ‘In the Shape of a Circle’. In two of these cases, the original similes were redundant with other similes in the collection. In one, the original simile was more of historical than of practical interest.
</p><p>
One of the original similes – ‘Water Drops, Water Streams’ – includes a few extra sentences from the Dhamma talk in which it appeared.
</p><p>
Some of the titles for the similes have been changed to work more effectively in English.
</p><p>
The order of the similes has been changed to provide a more organic sense of unity and flow.
</p><p>
Ajahn Jandee transcribed his collection directly from recordings of Ajahn Chah’s talks with minimal editing, and I have tried to follow his example by giving as full and accurate translation as I can. The unpolished nature of some of the similes is precisely what reveals unexpected layers of meaning, making them so provocative, and I hope that this translation succeeds in conveying some of the same unfinished, thought-provoking quality in English as well.
</p><p>
Several people have looked over the original manuscript and have provided helpful recommendations for improving it. In particular, I would like to thank Ajahn Pasanno, Ginger Vathanasombat, and Michael Zoll.
</p><p>
May all those who read this translation realize Ajahn Chah’s original intention in explaining the Dhamma in such simple and graphic terms.
