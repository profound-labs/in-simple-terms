{\itshape `\ldots{} The Dhamma is just like this, talking in similes,\\
because the Dhamma doesn't have anything.\\
It isn't round, doesn't have any corners.\\
There's no way to get acquainted with it except through\\
comparisons like this. If you understand this,\\
you understand the Dhamma.'
\bigskip

`Don't think that the Dhamma lies far away from you.\\ It lies right with you; it's about you. Take a look.\\ One minute happy, the next minute sad, satisfied,\\ then angry at this person, hating that person:\\ it's all Dhamma \ldots{}'
